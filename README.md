# Data-Mining I
Task 1:
In this task, I will address the question: "Is it possible to forecast patient readmission using chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, and healthcare services?" The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method will be applied to answer this research question.

The objective of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of a patient's readmission to the hospital by examining their chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, and the types of healthcare services they have received.

Task 2:
In this task, I will investigate the question: "Is it possible to forecast patient readmission using a decision tree classification method?"

The goal of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of a patient's readmission to the hospital using the decision tree classification method.
